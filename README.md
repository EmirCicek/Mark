This is a simple voice asistant.

It's name Mark. For now he can just understand Turkish but it can be depends on the future. I am thinkink add English to Mark. Proboutly I will add this on Mark 2. For now it understand Turkish. 
If you call Mark, it will say "I am listening to you". After that you should say your prompt.
