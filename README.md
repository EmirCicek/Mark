# Mark
This is a simple voice asistant.

Its name is Mark. For now, it can only understand Turkish, but this may change in the future. I am thinking of adding English to Mark in Mark 2. Currently, he understands Turkish. If you call Mark, he will say 'I am listening to you.' After that, you should state your prompt.
